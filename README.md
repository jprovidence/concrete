This is not the final version of the _ticket graph-store. Due to an algorithmic error this program is not used.
Rather, for the final graph store see Fiber. Still, functions from this repo may still be used via the Haskell 
FFI, so it lives on. There are some structs which were never implemented.

NOTE also, the last commits were never properly 'Valgrinded' so running with argv[1] "test" may show up memory
leaks. Or not.
